# Module 3: Obtaining Training Data {#module-3 .unnumbered}

## General Description

In supervised classification, the quality of training data directly determines the accuracy of the resulting model. This module provides two options for preparing training samples: (1) importing user-defined training data, or (2) interactively generating training data through system-guided tools. By the end of this module, the user will have a structured training dataset for each land use/land cover class, along with statistical diagnostics to assess the quality of the samples for classification.

# Feature Notes

-   User’s training data

    The system performs an automated verification process to ensure compatibility. The checks include:

    1.  **Data format**:
        -   Accepted formats are shapefiles (`.shp` with supporting files: `.shx`, `.prj`, `.dbf`) or tabular data (`.csv` or `.xlsx`).
        -   Shapefiles must contain point geometries only — line or polygon geometries are not supported.
        -   Tabular data must include three mandatory columns: *X-coordinate, Y-coordinate,* and *land use class*.
    2.  **Land use class consistency**:
        -   All land use classes in the training data must match the class definitions established in [Module 2](module02.qmd).
        -   If mismatches are detected, the system will flag the inconsistent classes. The user can then either:
            1.  Re-upload corrected training data, or
            2.  Add the missing or inconsistent samples through the system’s on-screen sampling interface.

    -   On-screen sampling

    The system provides an interactive tool for creating training data directly within the platform. Users can select specific map coordinates and assign the corresponding land use/land cover class to each point.

    -   RESTORE+ training data [@hadi_national-scale_2022]
    -   Public training data

-   Statistical quality assessment of training data The selected training data are then evaluated for quality based on their spectral band values. The quality indicators include:

    -   Descriptive statistics of band values for each class

    -   Separability index of band values using the Jeffries–Matusita distance between classes

These statistical results are then compiled and presented to the user in a summary report.
