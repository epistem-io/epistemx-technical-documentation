        "In supervised classification, the quality of training data directly determines the accuracy of the resulting model. The output of Module 3 is to produce georeferenced point vector datasets for each LULC class defined by the user in the preceding step, [Module 2](@sec-module-2), accompanied by quantitative and visual summaries that facilitate rigorous evaluation, quality control, and optimization for subsequent classification. The module supports two workflows for data preparation: (1) importing user-defined datasets, or (2) interactively generating samples using system-guided tools. Upon completion, the user obtains a structured datasets for each LULC class, together with statistical diagnostics to assess the quality and representativeness of the data prior to classification.\n",
