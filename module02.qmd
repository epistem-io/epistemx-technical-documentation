# Module 2: Determining LULC Classification Schema and Classes {#module-2 .unnumbered}

The Epistem landscape monitoring technology addresses data gaps for stakeholders in Nature-based Solutions (NbS) interventions. To support planning, monitoring, and evaluation (PME), it integrates a LULC classification framework with sufficient thematic detail to capture diverse NbS activities, including conservation, land management, and ecosystem restoration, with an emphasis on carbon sequestration and biodiversity. A key feature is its adaptability: users can generate maps with customizable classification schemesâ€”from broad outputs like deforestation maps to detailed products reflecting specific management practices or prioritized classes for greater accuracy. This flexibility aligns with the FAO [LCCS](https://www.fao.org/4/x0596e/x0596e00.htm), supporting class combinations and hierarchical structures.

The output of this module is a well-defined list of LULC classes, structured according to either a hierarchical or non-hierarchical classification schema.

-   In a hierarchical classification system, LULC classes are organized in multiple levels of thematic detail. Broader classes, such as Natural Forest or Agroforestry are subdivided into more specific subclasses. This structure forms a tree-like taxonomy, enabling analysis at different scales and levels of detail. For example, a national-level analysis might only use Level 1 categories while a local restoration project could use Level 3 or Level 4 categories. This approach aligns with frameworks such as the FAO LCCS. The classification schema shown in Fig. XXX illustrates the hierarchical system applied in the RESTORE+ project

-   In a non-hierarchical classification system, all classes are treated independently, without parent-child relationships. This structure is simpler to implement and suitable for applications where only one level of classification is required, such as generating a deforestation map or identifying priority conservation areas.

## Development Phases of Module 2

-   Phase 1: Non-hierarchical classification schema
-   Phase 2: Hierarchical classification schema
-   Phase 3: User-generated classification schema developed within the Epistem ecosystem

## User's Input

-   Near cloud-free satellite imagery provided in Module 1
-   Option to select a classification schema, either hierarchical or non-hierarchical
-   User-defined list of land cover or land use classes, entered in a tabular format to specify the categories to be mapped.

### Workflow description

This workflow ensures that the user selected the type of classification scheme

1.  **User Selection of Classification Schema Options**

    -   The system displays a button or selection interface allowing the user to choose between a hierarchical or non-hierarchical classification schema.
        1.  If non-hierarchical is selected, the system provides a form/table with two columns: ID, Class Name, and Colour
        2.  If hierarchical is selected, the system provides a table with three columns: ID, Level, Class Name, and Colour. This process is supported by a hierarchical UI form to simplify the creation of multi-level class structures.

2.  **Validation of Input Data**

    -   The system checks the entered data for completeness and correctness
    -   Feedback is provided to the user
        -   If the data is valid, the user is allowed to proceed to the next step.
        -   If there are errors or missing inputs, the system notifies the user with specific guidance on what needs to be corrected

3.  **Saving the Classification Table**

    Once validated, the classification table is stored as a variable within the system for use in subsequent modules.
