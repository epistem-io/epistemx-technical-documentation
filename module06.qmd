# Module 6: LULC Map Generation {#sec-module-0}

# Module Overview {.unnumbered}

This module provides functionality for users to generate the final LULC map as the primary output product, derived from the validated and optimized classification model developed in Modules 1-5. Before the processing begins, it ensures that all required inputs - such as satellite imagery, classification schemes, and training samples - are properly prepared and validated. Users can specify data splits, select classification modes, perform hyperparameter tuning optimization, and apply the trained model to the entire AOI to produce a high-quality, georeferenced LULC map. The module supports phased workflows (Phase 1: simple RF-based; Phase 2: flexible algorithm with rules; Phase 3: object-based) for adaptability, aligning with hierarchical or non-hierarchical schemes from [Module 2](@sec-module-2), and incorporates feedback from optional covariate enhancements in [Module 5](@sec-module-5). Upon completion, users receive a displayable, analyzable, and downloadable map with metadata, enabling applications such as deforestation monitoring or conservation planning.
