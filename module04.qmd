# Module 4: Training and Hyperparameter Tuning of LULC Classification Models {#sec-module-4}

# Module Overview {.unnumbered}

This module enables users to generate accurate LULC maps by selecting or training classification models, optimizing them through hyperparameter tuning, and validating their compatibility with user data. Users can either use existing models from other users or apply system-recommended parameters to train a new model. In the back-end, these parameters are used to train and evaluate a Random Forest (RF) classifier, resulting in a land use and land cover model with measurable quality and a georeferenced LULC map ready for download or further analysis.

## Selection of LULC Classification Model

### Selection of LULC Classification Model {#sec-selection-of-lulc-classification-model}

#### Back-end

-   If the user chooses to use the pre-trained model, the system proceeds to @sec-using-existing-model
-   If the user chooses to train a new model, the system proceeds to @sec-create-new-model

#### Front-end

The user can choose two options for LULC classification models:

1.  Use a pre-trained model (from the system or another user)
2.  Train a new model

## Using Existing Model {#sec-using-existing-model}

### Model validation and compability {#sec-model-validation-and-compability}

#### Back-end:

-   The system checks whether the model’s classification scheme matches the user’s scheme.
-   If incompatible, the system recommends training a new model.
-   Users can manually verify compatibility if desired.

#### Front-end

-   If compatible, the user can proceed to Module 5.
-   If not compatible, the user is prompted to create a new model (@sec-create-new-model).

## Create New Model {#sec-create-new-model}

### Selecting Classification Algorithm to Train a New Model {#sec-selecting-classification-algorithm-to-train-a-new-model}

#### Back-end

1.  The system can automatically generate optimal hyperparameters for Random Forest, including: number of trees, variables per split, and minimum leaf size.
2.  Classification can be performed in three modes:
    -   Hard Classification (Fast and Simple)
        -   Assigns each pixel to exactly one class using a single-split mechanism.
        -   Model performance is evaluated using accuracy against the test dataset.
        -   Best suited for quick classifications with simple, non-hierarchical LULC classification such as Forest, Wetland Agriculture, Water Body, and Settlement.
    -   Soft Classification (Moderate Complexity)
        -   Uses a one-vs-rest binary approach.
        -   Estimates the probability of each pixel belonging to each class instead of assigning it directly.
        -   Model performance is reported using log loss (cross-entropy); lower values indicate better parameters.
        -   Produces probability values for each land cover class, with the final map generated using rules or by selecting the highest probability per pixel.
    -   Hierarchical Classification (Advanced)
        -   Supports classification with nested or multi-level/hierarchy schemes.
3.  For each classification mode, the system provides a description along with its trade-offs

#### Front-end

User is given the option to choose which classification algorithm to train the Random Forest classifier model

## Hyperparameter Tuning

### Splitting the Training Data {#sec-splitting-the-training-data}

#### Back-end

1.  Users can split training data into training and validation/test sets.
2.  Options:
    1.  Custom partition: User specifies the ratio (e.g., 70% training / 30% testing).
    2.  Default partition: System uses a predefined ratio automatically.

#### Front-end

The user selects an option and enters percentages if using a custom partition.

### Setting the hyperparameters {#sec-setting-the-hyperparameters}

#### Back-end

Options for the Random Forest’s model hyperparameter selection:

1.  Custom parameters: User can manually set values for parameters (e.g., number of trees, max depth, minimum leaf size).
2.  Default parameters: System applies recommended default values.

#### Front-end

User selects parameters and assigns values if using the custom option.

### Training and Validating the Model {#sec-training-and-validating-the-model}

#### Back-end

1.  The system trains the model using the selected hyperparameters and training data.
2.  Performance is evaluated on validation/test data.

#### Front-end

The user is notified of model performance, including accuracy or other relevant metrics.

### Selecting Best Hyperparameter Combination {#sec-selecting-best-hyperparameter-combination}

#### Back-end

System provides an options for model optimization

#### Front-end

Users can further optimize the model to improve classification performance.
