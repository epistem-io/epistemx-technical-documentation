## What is Epistem-X?

EPISTEM-X provides a modular, microservice-based backend for automated, reproducible LULC mapping. The pipeline supports multiple sensors (Sentinel-2, Landsat, ALOS, user-uploaded), non-imagery covariates (DEM, proximity rasters), and supervised machine learning (RF, XGBoost, SVM). The design goals are: automation, flexibility, scalability, and provenance. Proposed solutions, strategies, and next steps.
