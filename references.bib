	abstract = {The current land cover (LC) mapping paradigm relies on automatic satellite imagery classification, predominantly through supervised methods, which depend on training data to calibrate classification algorithms. Hence, training data have a critical influence on classification accuracy. Although research on specific aspects of training data in the LC classification context exists, a study that organizes and synthetizes the multiplicity of aspects and findings of these researches is needed. In this article, we review the training data used for LC classification of satellite imagery. A protocol of identification and selection of relevant documents was followed, resulting in 114 peer-reviewed studies included. Main research topics were identified and documents were characterized according to their contribution to each topic, which allowed uncovering subtopics and categories and synthetizing the main findings regarding different aspects of the training dataset. The analysis found four research topics, namely construction of the training dataset, sample quality, sampling design and advanced learning techniques. Subtopics included sample collection method, sample cleaning procedures, sample size, sampling method, class balance and distribution, among others. A summary of the main findings and approaches provided an overview of the research in this area, which may serve as a starting point for new LC mapping initiatives.},

	abstract = {Here we present a geographically diverse, temporally consistent, and nationally relevant land cover (LC) reference dataset collected by visual interpretation of very high spatial resolution imagery, in a national-scale crowdsourcing campaign (targeting seven generic LC classes) and a series of expert workshops (targeting seventeen detailed LC classes) in Indonesia. The interpreters were citizen scientists (crowd/non-experts) and local LC visual interpretation experts from different regions in the country. We provide the raw LC reference dataset, as well as a quality-filtered dataset, along with the quality assessment indicators. We envisage that the dataset will be relevant for: (1) the LC mapping community (researchers and practitioners), i.e., as reference data for training machine learning algorithms and map accuracy assessment (with appropriate quality-filters applied), and (2) the citizen science community, i.e., as a sizable empirical dataset to investigate the potential and limitations of contributions from the crowd/non-experts, demonstrated for LC mapping in Indonesia for the first time to our knowledge, within the context of complementing traditional data collection by expert interpreters.},

	abstract = {Decision trees are attractive classifiers due to their high execution speed. But trees derived with traditional methods often cannot be grown to arbitrary complexity for possible loss of generalization accuracy on unseen data. The limitation on complexity usually means suboptimal accuracy on training data. Following the principles of stochastic modeling, we propose a method to construct tree-based classifiers whose capacity can be arbitrarily expanded for increases in accuracy for both training and unseen data. The essence of the method is to build multiple trees in randomly selected subspaces of the feature space. Trees in, different subspaces generalize their classification in complementary ways, and their combined classification can be monotonically improved. The validity of the method is demonstrated through experiments on the recognition of handwritten digits.},
