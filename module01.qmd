## Selection of AOI {#sec-selection-of-aoi}

::: callout-note
@sec-aoi-from-administrative-boundaries, @sec-aoi-from-shapefile, @sec-aoi-from-on-screen-digitizing are options.
:::

### AOI from Administrative Boundaries {#sec-aoi-from-administrative-boundaries}

**Front-end**

The user selects an administration boundary.

**Back-end**

The system queries the FAO Global Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL) 2015 datasets, which provide standardized information on country and sub-national boundaries, and saves the AOI as a variable

### AOI from Shapefile {#sec-aoi-from-shapefile}

**Front-end**

1.  The user can upload their `.SHP` file. in `.ZIP` format that includes all necessary files (`.SHP`, `.SHX`, `.DBF`, `.PRJ`).

**Back-end**

1.  The system currently supports only shapefiles in .ZIP format.
2.  An Upload button is provided, allowing the user to upload the file. It is then extracted to a temporary directory.

### AOI from On-Screen Digitizing {#sec-aoi-from-on-screen-digitizing}

**Front-end**

The user is presented with an interactive on-screen digitization process.

**Back-end**

\[not developed yet\]

## Validation of Shapefile Geometries {#sec-validation-of-shapefile-geometries}

### Validation of Shapefile Geometries

**Front-end**

1.  After the user uploads the shapefiles, they receive a feedback such as "AOI conversion completed!", "Failed to convert AOI to Google Earth Engine Format", "Geometry Validation Failed", "Error Reading Shapefile".

**Back-end**

1.  The `shapefile_validator` class validates shapefile geometries within a GeoDataFrame (.GDF). It corrects coordinate reference systems (CRS) to WGS 1984 (EPSG:4326), fixes invalid or empty geometries, validates point and polygon features, simplifies overly complex polygons, and removes features with invalid coordinates. A final geometry check is performed before converting the data into Earth Engine objects.

::: callout-tip

`validate_and_fix_geometry():`to validate and fix geometries issues.

`_clean_geometries():` to repair invalid geometries.

`_fix_crs ():` to resolve coordinate reference system issues.

`_is_valid_coordinates():` to ensure coordinates fall within a valid latitude and longitude ranges.

`_count_vertices():` to count the number of vertices in a geometry.

`_final_validation():` to perform final validation to ensure all geometries are valid.
:::

2.  If an error still occurs, the system displays an error message and suggests performing a shapefile simplification process using GIS software.

3.  The EE_converter class handles the conversion of cleaned GeoDataFrames into Earth Engine-compatible objects. It includes:

    -   Converts single-geometry AOI shapefiles into ee.Geometry objects, using fallback methods (GeoJSON or bounding box) if direct conversion fails.

        :::

    -   Throughout the process, the system provides detailed logging feedback via Streamlit, ensuring users are informed about validation progress, detected issues, and successful conversions.

    -   Finally, the system displays a small preview map centered on the AOI.

## Selection and Preparation of Satellite Imagery {#sec-selection-and-preparation-of-satellite-imagery}

### Initialization of Landsat Dataset {#sec-input-spatial-image-parameters}

**Back-end**

1.  The system declares Landsat collections for optical and thermal processing.
2.  The system currently supports Landsat 1-4 at sensor radiance and Landsat 5-9 collection 2 surface reflectance Analysis Ready Data (ARD). Landsat mission availability is as follows:
    -   Landsat 1 Multispectral Scanner/MSS (1972 - 1978)
    -   Landsat 2 Multispectral Scanner/MSS (1978 - 1982)
    -   Landsat 3 Multispectral Scanner/MSS (1978 - 1983)
    -   Landsat 4 Thematic Mapper/TM (1982 - 1993)
    -   Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper/TM (1984 - 2012)
    -   Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus/ETM+ (1999 - 2021)
    -   Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager/OLI (2013 - present)
    -   Landsat 9 Operational Land Imager-2/OLI-2 (2021 - present)
3.  The system rename bands per sensor type to standarize band namings, so all sensors have common names.

### Input Spatial Image Parameters

**Front-end**

The user is prompted to fill in these parameters:

1.  Spatial resolution (meters): Specify the desired spatial resolution.
2.  Input year: Choose either single-date or multi-year imagery.
3.  Maximum cloud cover: Set a preferred cloud cover threshold, or use the default value of 30%.

**Back-end**

1.  The system retrieves images that match user’s selected criteria, including spatial resolution, year, and cloud cover. From `get_optical_data()` receives all inputs: AOI, dates, dataset key, and cloud cover threshold.

::: callout-tip
## Related Function(s)

`get_optical_data():` to retrieve and the Landsat image collection based on the input parameters.
:::

2.  For single-year imagery, the system selects Landsat images from December 31st of year T or the lowest cloud cover scene available that year. For multi-year imagery, the system retrieves the lowest cloud cover image for each year in the specified range.

3.  The system then converts year input (e.g., 2022) into full date strings.

::: callout-tip
## Related Function(s)

`parse_year_or_date():` to standardize time inputs into `ee.Date` object.
:::

4.  The system clips and mosaics the selected satellite imagery to match the user’s AOI and date range.

5.  The system performs cloud masking in three steps: cloud detection, mask refinement, and image compositing. The QA_PIXEL band encodes pixel conditions using specific bit flags. `Bitwise AND` operations are applied to isolate these conditions, focusing on clouds (bit 4, value 16) and cloud shadows (bit 3, value 8). Pixels matching these flags are excluded to produce a cleaner, near cloud-free image.

::: callout-tip
## Related Function(s)

`mask_landsat_sr():` to mask cloud and cloud shadow.
:::

5.  The system evaluates whether the retrieved imagery meets the required spatial resolution, input year, and cloud cover thresholds.

6.  If there is no satellite imagery available for the user's input parameters, proceed to @sec-satellite-imagery-cannot-be-found

### Satellite Imagery Not Found Based on User’s Parameters {#sec-satellite-imagery-cannot-be-found}

**Front-end**

The user is prompted to adjust parameters, such as increasing the cloud cover limit, selecting a different time period, or choosing a different spatial resolution.The user will then get a feedback: "No images found for the selected criteria, increase cloud cover threshold or change the date range".

**Back-end**

1.  Before prompting the user to insert new parameters, the system searches imagery from year T to T-2 to replace cloudy areas via image compositing.
2.  If requirements remain unmet, @sec-input-spatial-image-parameters will re-run based on new user parameters.

## Visualization and Saving Data {#sec-visualization-and-saving-data}

### Visualization and Saving Data

**Front-end**

1.  The user can visualize the near cloud-free imagery within the web portal and download it as a GeoTIFF (`.TIF` )

2.  Prior to initiating the image download, the user inputs technical parameters of the image that includes: file name, coordinate system, and spatial resolution.

3.  If the user chooses not to download it, they may proceed to [Module 2](@sec-module-2).

4.  A summary report containing the metadata is provided as a `.TXT` file that includes:

    -   Total images found
    -   Data range of images
    -   Unique WRS tiles
    -   Path row tiles
    -   Scene IDs
    -   Image acquisition dates
    -   Average scene cloud cover
    -   Date range
    -   Cloud cover range

**Back-end**

1.  The system produces near-cloud-free Landsat imagery for the defined AOI, saves it as a variable, and visualizes the processed datasets.

2.  A summary report of metadata is generated, including acquisition details, cloud cover statistics, and a summary of processing steps applied.
