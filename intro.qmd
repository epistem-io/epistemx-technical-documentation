# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This document is a technical specification for the Epistem-X workflow. It is intended for back-end engineers, remote sensing scientists, data engineers, and DevOps to implement a production-ready mapping pipeline.

## System Overview

The envisioned landscape monitoring system is designed to comprise three core components, as illustrated in @fig-overall-system-architecture. These components work in an integrated manner to provide a robust, scalable, and flexible solution for generating high-quality Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) maps. By combining advanced algorithms, structured reference data, and user-friendly interfaces, the system will support diverse stakeholders in monitoring, managing, and making informed decisions about landscapes.

## Epistem-X Development Phases

Epistem-X will progress through a structured development lifecycle consisting of three phases. Phase 1 is targeted for completion by December 2025, followed by Phase 2, which is planned for delivery by June 2026.

### Phase 1: Express Map {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Phase 1 User's Focus

Users seeking to create their first land cover map quickly, easily, and with high-quality results.
:::

Phase 1 serves as the primary entry point for all Epistem users. The platform provides a guided workflow designed to produce standardized, high-quality maps with minimal complexity. Users follow a core set of steps to achieve results without navigating complex options.

### Phase 2: Map Studio {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Phase 2 User's Focus

Users with foundational knowledge seeking more complex mapping, experimenting with additional datasets, and refining map details according to specific needs.

### Phase 3: Map Lab {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Phase 3 User's Focus

Users requiring in-depth analysis, collaborative workflows, and the ability to learn from other Epistem users.

## Modules Overview

The workflow for generating LULC maps consists of eight sequential modules:

[Module 1: Generating cloud-free satellite images](module01.qmd)

[Module 2: Determining the LULC classification schema and classes](module02.qmd)

[Module 3: Obtaining representative training data](module03.qmd)

[Module 4: Performing separability analysis and selecting covariates](module04.qmd)

[Module 5: Incorporating non-image covariates to improve model accuracy](module05.qmd)

[Module 6: Generating the preliminary LULC map](module06.qmd)

[Module 7: Assessing thematic accuracy using independent validation data](module07.qmd)

[Module 8: Performing post-classification analysis and data housekeeping](module08.qmd)

Each module builds on the previous one, ensuring a systematic and reproducible workflow from raw imagery to a validated, fully documented LULC map.
